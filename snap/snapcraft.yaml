summary: the revised BYTE UNIX benchmark suite
description: |
  UnixBench is the original BYTE UNIX benchmark suite, updated and revised by
  many people over the years.
  
  The purpose of UnixBench is to provide a basic indicator of the performance of
  a Unix-like system; hence, multiple tests are used to test various aspects of
  the system's performance. These test results are then compared to the scores
  from a baseline system to produce an index value, which is generally easier to
  handle than the raw scores. The entire set of index values is then combined to
  make an overall index for the system.
  
  Some very simple graphics tests are included to measure the 2D and 3D graphics
  performance of the system.
  
  Multi-CPU systems are handled. If your system has multiple CPUs, the default
  behaviour is to run the selected tests twice -- once with one copy of each test
  program running at a time, and once with N copies, where N is the number of
  CPUs. This is designed to allow you to assess:
  
   - the performance of your system when running a single task
   - the performance of your system when running multiple tasks
   - the gain from your system's implementation of parallel processing

  Do be aware that this is a system benchmark, not a CPU, RAM or disk
  benchmark. The results will depend not only on your hardware, but on your
  operating system, libraries, and even compiler.
